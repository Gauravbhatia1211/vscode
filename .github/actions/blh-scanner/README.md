MISS Framework - BLH Scanner
This GitHub Action implements the "Scan" pillar of the MISS (Manage, Inventory, Scan, Secure) framework.
It scans a repository for external URLs and checks for two critical Broken Link Hijacking (BLH) vulnerabilities:
 * Expired Domains: Links to domains that are broken and available for purchase.
 * Dangling DNS: Links to CNAME records that point to deprovisioned cloud resources (e.g., deleted Azure Blobs or S3 Buckets).
Outputs
 * report_path: The path to the generated blh_report.json file.
